{"1": "I have seen like really serious comments for this really funny movie. Guys please calm down and chill. It's as you can see just a comedy. Do comedies always follow the real life and perfect mentality? I don't think so. I love it especially Cengiz Bozkurt is -in a word l-amazing. I cried when I was laughing. Soundtrack also amazing! Go on Ali Atay and every single person who support or contribute this. I might be a little bit emotional because of this negative comments but only reason is I really like this movie and couldn't believe all those comments"}
{"2": "When you first look at the cast, you keep your expectations high. However, the scenario is not successful. They tried to build the film through the dialogue of several actors. Too much swearing. Most of them are unnecessary.\nThere is no striking effect in the final because the scenario of the flow is weak. You cut the expectation of the final.\nI think the interrogation scene is the best in the movie. A double-sided mirror joke was also very good.\nIt was under mediocre when it could be better..."}
{"3": "After the \"\u00d6lumlu D\u00fcnya\" my expectations was prety high before i saw this movie. Now Ali Atay raised this level up. He has directed story on the base of popular crime movies but most of the scenes has a refer to absurd detective stories except the message at the end . Cengiz Bozkurt aka \"Erdal Bakkal\" was perfect as tired detective who leads the humour all the way. Billingsgate seems like the bad part but be sure it is not stilted at all. Besides it completes the spirit of Atay's sense of humor like \"Kutu Kola\". Feyyaz Yigit and Binnur Kaya was a great couple and wierd lovers. I can't wait the next job of Atay."}
{"4": "A great movie with nice cast and story! Nice work Ali Atay."}
{"5": "When there is a lot of material and work on the story and the script, it seems that the use of the film has not been fully decided. Sometimes in a hurry, sometimes slow. Despite everything, Ali Atay should be watched for cinema and dark comedy."}
{"6": "I liked it. Lots of Turkish style black humour. Lots stupid funny jokes on the spot."}
{"7": "I came to movie theater with a little high expectations.. The actors are great and they made me laugh a lot before..But in this movie.. This scripts and dialogs just make me think I must try to make a movie too.. Me and most of my friends can write better jokes.."}
{"8": "Unfortunately I expect more than that. Clearly it was not sure what about to tell us all.\nSeems classical saying \"overrated\" for me! so I watched first cinema film by this team I expect more and more. But you can enjoy without expectation. ///Please don't swearing a lot like that . It make you seems camply. And it wasn't funny too this time"}
{"9": "Storytelling is really bad and its like the most booring movie ive ever seen dont watch it it is not worth you time."}
{"10": "Brilliantly funny movie like the previous movie of the director, if only there was a little less sexual talking... It felt really awkward watching some scenes with my family together. Accept that, i hope we see more of his humor in theaters."}
{"11": "There were so many boring and self-replicating diolags that I couldn't stand it and left the film in half. Dont waste ur time."}
{"12": "I saw a trailer for this movie on Youtube and decided to watch it. This movie is way more funnier than a similar movie by the same director \" \u00d6l\u00fcml\u00fc D\u00fcnya\". I think that the director has really improved himself. Acting and visual comedy elements were great. Everyone watching the film at the cinema laughed a good amount of times."}
{"13": "I didnt expect this movie to top previous Ali Atay movie, \"\u00d6l\u00fcml\u00fc D\u00fcnya\" but it exceeded all my expectations. No forced jokes, no unrealistic characters, everthing feels so real. Ali Atay proves that the first movie was no coincidence. The message at the end was also pretty neat."}
{"14": "Those who watched the previous film, they also love this film. (olumlu dunya)\nI had fun, the movie was funny. I would recommend it to everyone"}
{"15": "Oh my god what is this s**t show... are these the people who created ''\u00f6l\u00fcml\u00fc d\u00fcnya''... i can't believe this awful script written by a teenager minded poor guy which is not funny at all ... What a disappontment"}
{"16": "It's like Willem Defoe's Anamorph with a touch of humour. I like Ali Atay anyway. Worth to see."}
{"17": "Very funny comedy movie with realistic scenario with message. Cast performance is great. Feyyaz yigit proving his comedy skills with humble. 10 star comedy."}
{"18": "The movie is exactly like how a comedy movie supposed to be. Without a doubt it is funny. The ending is so satisfying. The scenario is very well-written in terms of misery and crime solving but it also manages to be extremely funny. I highly recommend"}
{"19": "Cheap and dirty jokes. It seems this team can't produce comedy without slangy language. Waste of time. It deserves zero point but i should give 1 star.."}
{"20": "The movie is a big joke itself. Didn't go to see it with extraordinary expectations yet it wasn't capable to fulfill anything at all. Awkward conversations were supposed to be funny unfortunately they were not even close to trigger a giggle. Ali Atay tries to make absurd comedy movies but he can only catch the absurd side of it. Big local stars are wasted in this garbage, especially Ugur Y\u00fccel couldn't get any chance to show his acting skills. Waste of money and time. Plot would be interesting if it was processed better with creative dialogues."}
{"21": "Bad too bad toooooo bad\nAfter the \"olumlu dunya\", I had expectations of this movie, But It was exactly time loss"}
{"22": "Newbie director of turkish TV came into media we would have many expectations for him. the first dark humour film which name \"\u00f6l\u00fcml\u00fc d\u00fcnya\" do not great production However we were gladly satisfy due to reach a new kind of things on tv.but this one bloody beyond our tolerance limit and expectations. Mr. Atay may be developped his film skills but not reflect any other issues. If Safak Sezer could be play as Dizdar Kosu we were not noticed that huge differences.Feyyaz supposed to high volume yelling is the best act way instead of playing which the crew or community never accept that."}
{"23": "The cast is amazing, Cengiz, Ugur, Binnur but the roles did not fit too much. Only Cengiz Bozkurts role was good. Binnur Kaya is a talented actress but not a cop!!! The script is good but soap opera. Can be watched on TV but if u go to a cinema and spend time and money, absolutely wasted"}
{"24": "I don't know how someone like this movie. All they showed us is stupidity. A smart man can't laugh the jokes* (If there is any). Acting was bad, storytelling was horrible (there is no story in deed). Was so hard to watch. The reason I finished watching is I don't like the idea of unfinished movies that's why. If you hate yourself and make yourself suffer, watch."}
{"25": "Great team, great job \ud83d\udc4d\nI think this movie is better than other turkish movies"}
